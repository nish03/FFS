# FFS: Normalizing Flow based Feature Synthesis for Outlier-Aware Object Detection
This repository provides the source code for the CVPR 2023 highlight paper by N. Kumar et al. The key contributions of the paper are as follows:
* Learns inlier features using invertible Normalizing Flow model within the object detection framework. 
* Generates synthetic outlier features in the inverse direction after random sampling from the latent space of the Flow model. 
* Regularizes the object detection framework to make it outlier-aware via discriminative training procedure that separates the energy surface of the synthesized outliers and inlier features.
